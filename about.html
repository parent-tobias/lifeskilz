         <p class="p1-1">What qualifies a person to be a “life coach”?  Is it 
           about where they studied?  How many certifications 
           they have and organizations they  belong to?  Just 
           how does a person prepare or study to assist 
           others in being the best they can be in a very cold 
           and demanding world? I believe first and foremost 
           the gifts required to coach, mentor, and counsel 
           others are given by God. The day we were born 
           and our life experiences coupled with education, 
           allow for the development of those skilz. Some 
           people know what they want to be when they grow 
           up early on, but the majority of us figure this out as 
           we live our lives.  In my life experience I am currently 
           or have been the following: </p>

      <p class="p1-3">I believe the Bible is the ultimate manual for instruction on how to live in this world. With correct understanding devoid of traditional “religious” traps and bondages its principles are accurate and true and applying its principles will guarantee a successful and fulfilling life.<p>

      <p class="p1-3">I have been given unique gifts, talents, and insights in order to observe and get a great understanding of human nature in my time on this earth. Not the type of information taught in schools of higher learning with their theories and hypotheses, but real life experiences of myself and others I have been privileged to be around. I take these life experiences along with a fresh understanding of the Bible absent of “religion” and use it to equip others to experience a more abundant life and navigate them away from many of the pitfalls and traps life can offer.</p>

      <p class="p1-3">Although my background comes from a Judeo-Christian, nondenominational, nontraditional religious perspectives, I believe I have much to offer those who do not believe as I do and from a nonjudgmental place.  My job is to live and share what I know and it is your job to decide as to whether what I have to offer will work for you.  We are all given free will and free choice.</p>
